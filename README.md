# Bike Sales Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and purchasing patterns using a Bike Sales Dataset. The goal of the analysis is to uncover insights that influence bike purchases by examining demographic, economic, and lifestyle factors. Microsoft Excel was used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
## Dataset Used

## Questions (KPIs)
- What factors influence bike purchasing decisions?
- Which customer segments are most likely to purchase bikes?
- How do income, age, and commute distance affect bike sales?
- How do demographic and regional differences impact bike purchases?
-  Dashboard Interaction <a href="https://github.com/sikaleg/Bike-Sales-Analysis-MS-Excel-/blob/main/Screenshot%202026-01-29%20102333.png">View Dashboard </a>

## Process
- Verified the dataset for missing values, duplicates, and anomalies, and ensured data consistency by correcting data types, formats, and categorical values where necessary.
- Performed feature engineering by creating a new Age Bracket column to group customers into meaningful age categories for improved analysis.
- Created pivot tables based on key business questions and KPIs, using appropriate aggregations such as counts and averages to analyze bike purchasing behavior.
- Developed visualizations (2D Column and 2D Line charts) from the pivot tables and merged them into a single interactive dashboard titled Bike Sales Dashboard.
- Applied slicers (Marital Status, Region, and Education) to enable dynamic filtering and interactive exploration of the data.
